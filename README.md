## History
Bharatnatyam was originated in Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India. It is a classical dance and is 1000's of years old. Currently it is ***one of eight*** official classical dances of India as per the Sangeet Natak Academy, which is recognized by the national Ministry of Culture in India. The dance form itself represents south Indian culture and ideas and both genders participate. The dance is also religous, with its principals in favour of Hinduism, and more speicifcally ***Shavism***. Per Hindu beleifs, it is said that the dance form was first performed by the natraja, a form of Lord Shiva. The origonal name of the dance was Sadiraatam, however in 1932 the name was changed to Bharatanatyam by Rukmani Devi Arundale and E. Krisha Iyer. They did this as an attept to reignite the ancient art from which was close to dying off because of British Rule. All temple dance was banned during colonization and temple dancers were seen distastfully even by Indians themselves. Many dancers during British Raj learned their art forms in secret. 

Bharatnatyam places a large emphasis on hand gestures and facial expressions. In order to hightlight eye movements, dancers wear long eyeliner to place the audience's attention to their eyes. The word bharat has "bha" in it which means feeling and "ragam" which means melody or rhythm. 

A dancer goes through years of training to eventually complete their arangathram, which is their solo debut performance symbolizing the end of the training and start of a professional dance career. Usually for most dancers, ***training takes roughly 10-12 years***, however it can be less or more depending on their Guru, or teacher's, opinion. ***A traditional arangathram consists of 7-8 different dances which takes roughly 3 hours***. Most dancers choose to do this solo, howeer some may choose to do it in pairs or small groups.

## Why I dance
I began dancing when I was 10 years old with my first teacher, Rupal Patel, at [Omkara Academy of Dance](http://omkaraacademy.com/). I didn't know much about the dance form at all. Actually, I didn't even know the name of the dance. I learned about it along the way. I stayed with my first teacher for a little over a year before I moved to the US. I did my very first performance with her and it really changed my perpective on dance. I saw older and more trained girls dancing very skillfully and fast. I looked up to them a lot. I knew that I wanted to continue dancing so one day I can do the same things they can. My timeline of dance is very inconsistant. 

  - June 2018: Started Dancing
  - September 2018: First Performance [Omkara Academy Annual Performance](https://youtu.be/3r_t385efQk?si=DrfTDRt7oSJBwwsn)
  - August 2019: Moved to the US
  - September-December 2019: New Dance Academy and settling in
  - March 2020: Online Dance
  - Summer-Fall of 2021: Small in class practices

Many things changed quickly for me over 3 years. These changes almost made me want to quit dancing but I kept going because I had a dream to be a "grown-up" dancer and perform longer and more complex pieces on stage. 

## How to Start
My personal opinion on starting dance is to just go for it. Your teacher(s) will help you with understanding the dance and performing. There are many dance academies in Southern California and a few here in Cerritos as well. Staying consistant with practice really helps with memorization, especially since many dances ae more than 10 minutes and one, called Varnam, is 45 minutes!
