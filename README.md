## History
Bharatnatyam was originated in Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India. It is a classical dance and is 1000's of years old. Currently it is ***one of eight*** official classical dances of India as per the Sangeet Natak Academy, which is recognized by the national Ministry of Culture in India. The dance form itself represents south Indian culture and ideas. The dance is also religous, with its principals in favour of Hinduism, and more speicifcally ***Shavism***. Per Hindu beleifs, it is said that the dance form was first performed by the natraja, a form of Lord Shiva. The origonal name of the dance was Sadiraatam, however in 1932 the name was changed to Bharatanatyam by Rukmani Devi Arundale and E. Krisha Iyer. They did this as an attept to reignite the ancient art from which was close to dying off because of British Rule. All temple dance was banned during colonization and temple dancers were seen distastfully even by Indians themselves. Many dancers during British Raj learned their art in secret.
